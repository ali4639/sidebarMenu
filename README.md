# sidebarMenu
Beautiful sidebar menu using HTML, CSS, JavaScript </br>
I am Ali Azarban, a master's student in software engineering from Urmia branch of Azad University. </br>In this tutorial, I have designed a beautiful sidebar menu using HTML, CSS, javascript that you can use in your projects. You can also add your favorite style to this project as the theme files are individually written and can be modified. I hope it will be used by everyone. Thanks
